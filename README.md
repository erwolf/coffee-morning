This a collection of projects I wrote from scratch for my Java class.

The Acrostic class takes in a string from the command line and turns it into an acrostic.

The Array Queue class implements a queue (and all of the queue library methods) using an array.

Factorial/GCD/both is a little application that either gives the user the factorial of one number, or the Greatest Common Denominator of both inputs.

Reverse Polish Notation (also called postfix notation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) uses and translates input from a Stack to  perform mathematics.

I didn't include any of my exception classes, because I feel I've supplied you with enough code to crawl through already.
